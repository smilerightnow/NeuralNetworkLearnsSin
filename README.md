# NeuralNetworkLearnsSinFunction

It's not perfect, I need to read more about Neural Networks

This is my first ever NN.

this is the current output:
```
45°  0.7260837863014028  ≈  0.707
60°  0.8417629354413934  ≈  0.866
90°  0.9508707393549799  ≈  1.0
30°  0.5466534951265191  ≈  0.5
20°  0.3876776712522434  ≈  0.342
180°  0.9987324119911676  ≈  0.0 <== this needs to be near zero but it's not.
```
A stackoverflow user told me that this is not a Neural Network, It's just a function :/ I guess it needs more layers ? I will try to fix it in the future
